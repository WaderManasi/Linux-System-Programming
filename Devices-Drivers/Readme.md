- There are two types of FILES.
	- Regular files
	- Special files
		- Device files
		- FIFO
- There are two types of DEVICE FILES (based on types of devices)
	- Character devices: Byte by Byte data
	- Block devices: Any number of Bytes
- #### Block drivers have a completely different interface to the kernel than Char devices ####
- Character Devices:
	- Can be accessed as a stream of bytes.
	- Implements at least the OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE system calls.
	- Eg. of char devices: 
		- Text console (/dev/console)
		- Serial ports (/dev/ttyS0)
- Block Devices:
	- It permits transfer of any number of bytes of data.
	- Are accessed by filesystem nodes in /dev directory
	- It is a device which can host  a file system.
	- Eg. of block devices:
		- Disk
- Network Interfaces:
	- A device that is  able to exchange data with other hosts.
	- A Network Interface is in charge of Sending & Receiving data packets ,which is driven by network subsystem of kernel.
	- A Network driver knows nothing about individual connections ,it only Handles Packets.
	- Communication between the "Kernel & Network device driver" is completely different than of char and block drivers.
	- Instead of READ ,WRITE the kernel calls functions related to Packets Transmission.
